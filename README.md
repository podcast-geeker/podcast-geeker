### Built With

[![Python][Python]][Python-url] [![Next.js][Next.js]][Next-url] [![React][React]][React-url] [![SurrealDB][SurrealDB]][SurrealDB-url] [![LangChain][LangChain]][LangChain-url]

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- That's it! (API keys configured later in the UI)

### Step 1: Get docker-compose.yml

**Option A:** Download directly
```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfnovo/open-notebook/main/docker-compose.yml
```

**Option B:** Create the file manually
Copy this into a new file called `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  surrealdb:
    image: surrealdb/surrealdb:v2
    command: start --log info --user root --pass root rocksdb:/mydata/mydatabase.db
    user: root
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./surreal_data:/mydata
    restart: always

  open_notebook:
    image: podcast-geeker:v1:v1-latest
    ports:
      - "8502:8502"
      - "5055:5055"
    environment:
      - OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-me-to-a-secret-string
      - SURREAL_URL=ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc
      - SURREAL_USER=root
      - SURREAL_PASSWORD=root
    volumes:
      - ./notebook_data:/app/data
    depends_on:
      - surrealdb
    restart: always
```

### Step 2: Set Your Encryption Key
Edit `docker-compose.yml` and change this line:
```yaml
- OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-me-to-a-secret-string
```
to any secret value (e.g., `my-super-secret-key-123`)

### Step 3: Start Services
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Wait 15-20 seconds, then open: **http://localhost:8502**

### Step 4: Configure AI Provider
1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Add Credential**
3. Choose your provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
4. Paste your API key and click **Save**
5. Click **Test Connection** → **Discover Models** → **Register Models**

Done! You're ready to create your first notebook.

> **Need an API key?** Get one from:
> [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) · [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) · [Google](https://aistudio.google.com/) · [Groq](https://console.groq.com/) (free tier)

> **Want free local AI?** See [examples/docker-compose-ollama.yml](examples/) for Ollama setup
