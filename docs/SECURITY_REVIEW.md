## Date: 2026-01-27 (Updated: 2026-01-28)
## Reviewer: Security Audit

## Summary

Security review of the API key management implementation for Open Notebook. The implementation uses a database-first approach with environment variable fallback.

---

## Encryption

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fernet encryption implemented | PASS | `open_notebook/utils/encryption.py` uses AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 |
| Keys encrypted before DB storage | PASS | `encrypt_value()` applied on save |
| Keys decrypted only when needed | PASS | `decrypt_value()` called when reading |
| Encryption key required | PASS | No default key; ValueError if not configured |
| Docker secrets support | PASS | `_FILE` suffix pattern supported |
| Documented in .env.example | PASS | Encryption key documented |

---

## API Security

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Test endpoint implemented | PASS | `connection_tester.py` validates keys |
| Test doesn't expose keys | PASS | Only returns success/failure |
| Error messages don't leak info | PASS | Generic error messages |
| URL validation for SSRF | PASS | Blocks private IPs (except Ollama) |
| Rate limiting | NOT IMPL | Future enhancement |

---

## Frontend Security

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| No keys in localStorage | PASS | Keys only in React state during entry |
| Keys masked in UI | PASS | Shows `************` placeholder |
| No keys in console.log | PASS | No logging of sensitive data |
| autocomplete attributes | PARTIAL | Some forms missing autocomplete="off" |

---

## Authentication

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Password protection | PASS | Bearer token authentication |
| Default password | PASS | "open-notebook-change-me" when not set |
| Docker secrets support | PASS | `_FILE` suffix for password |
| Security warnings | PASS | Logged when using defaults |

---

## Files Reviewed

| Component | Path | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Encryption | `open_notebook/utils/encryption.py` | PASS |
| Credential model | `open_notebook/domain/credential.py` | PASS |
| Credentials router | `api/routers/credentials.py` | PASS |
| Key provider | `open_notebook/ai/key_provider.py` | PASS |
| Connection tester | `open_notebook/ai/connection_tester.py` | PASS |
| Auth middleware | `api/auth.py` | PASS |
| Frontend forms | `frontend/src/components/settings/*.tsx` | PASS |
| Environment example | `.env.example` | PASS |

---

## Remaining Recommendations

### Future Improvements

1. **Rate limiting** - Add rate limiting on `/credentials/*` endpoints
2. **Autocomplete attributes** - Add `autocomplete="new-password"` to all password inputs
3. **Show last 4 characters** - Display `********xxxx` format for key identification
4. **Audit logging** - Log API key changes with timestamps

---

## Conclusion

The API Configuration UI implementation meets security requirements:

- API keys encrypted at rest using Fernet (key must be explicitly configured)
- Keys never returned to frontend
- URL validation prevents SSRF attacks
- Docker secrets supported for production deployments

**Review Status: PASS**
